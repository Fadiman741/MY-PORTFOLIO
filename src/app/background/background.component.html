    <p>I am an ambitious and dedicated aspiring Software Engineer with a deep-rooted desire to leverage technology as a catalyst
      for positive change. Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently demonstrated a natural talent for rapid learning,
      allowing me to quickly grasp new concepts and adapt to emerging technologies and challenges effortlessly. This innate
      ability, combined with my passion for developing innovative solutions, drives me to enhance the lives of individuals and
      communities through the power of technology.</p>
      <p>
      My educational background includes a Bachelor of Sciences in Computer Science from the University of the Western Cape,
      where I majored in Computer Science and Information Systems. Additionally, I have acquired valuable skills and knowledge
      through a Fundamentals of Digital Marketing Certificate from Google Digital Skills. These educational experiences have
      equipped me with a solid foundation in software engineering principles, programming languages, and web development
      methodologies.</p>
      <p>
      In terms of work experience, I am currently serving as a Software Developer (Intern) at TravelFindme (Pty) Ltd. In this role, I
      actively contribute to the creation, redesign, and modernization of websites using the Angular framework. I have successfully
      updated the company's API by adding new endpoints and implementing SQL queries. Moreover, I am responsible for ongoing
      website maintenance, updates, and the addition of new features to ensure functionality, security, and up-to-date content.</p>
      <p>
      My competencies extend to both frontend and backend development. I possess proficiency in REST
      APIs, CRUD methods, and have demonstrated a strong problem-solving ability. Furthermore, my experience with Adobe Suite
      (illustrator, Photoshop, XD) enables me to deliver high-quality prototypes and designs. Additionally, I am skilled in UML
      documentation, including Use Case Diagrams, ERD Diagrams, Class Diagrams, and Database Design, while also offering
      business analysis expertise.</p>
      <!-- <p>    Volunteering with the Promaths Alumni Society has allowed me to make a meaningful impact on the lives of students. As
      Treasurer from March 2019 to March 2020, I managed comprehensive financial operations, ensuring compliance with
      financial regulations. Additionally, I organized and executed team-building and motivational events, providing valuable
      guidance to high school learners in their career decision-making process.</p> -->
  
      <!-- <p>
      Throughout my career, I have engaged in various projects that exemplify my competence in web development and my ability
      to create functional and visually appealing applications. Notable examples include my contributions to Skybridge, a property
      website developed using Angular, Django, and MySQL, and my ongoing development of a dedicated academic hub for
      students, utilizing Django Rest Framework and MySQL. I have also collaborated on the development of a COVID-19 data web
      scraper using React, and built a weather app using Angular to present real-time weather data in a visually engaging and userfriendly interface.
